    Push chain fits **every projectâ€¦** **on every chain!**

    - **It allows developers** from any chain to create seamless full interop apps that can be used from any chain, via any wallet.<br />
    - **It allows users** the freedom to interact with the wallet of their choice or have a seamless signless experience via Push Universal Wallet with social login.<br />
    - **It allows shared app experiences** where users of all chains can come together and engage with universal DeFi, unified gaming, universal NFT, universal Governance, etc.<br />

    Push Chain brings seamless interoperability and unifies all L1s, L2s, & L3s and therefore is poised to become the playground of innovation and interop. You can build existing web3 use cases such as:

          value: `### Token Utility and Functionality

    Push Chain token is designed with multiple utilities that support the network's operation and growth.

    1. **Network Security** <br />
    \tThe token powers Push Chainâ€™s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism through staking and slashing, ensuring the security and reliability of the network. There are two types of staking:
    \t - PoS Staking: **Validator** need to stake tokens to run the chain and are rewarded / slashed.
    \t - Delegator Staking: **Token holders** can also delegate their tokens to validators to secure the network. In return, they get the majority of the staking rewards earned by the validators on their behalf.

    2. **Transaction Fees** <br />
    The token serves as the primary method for network fees for transactions and app usage.

    3. **Universal Fee Abstraction** <br />
    Pushâ€™s Universal Fee contract is used to enable users of any chain (whether ETH, SOL, etc) to pay for gas via native token or other supported tokens on cross chain. These are collected in USD equivalent and are converted to native token and burned.

    4. **Synthetic Assets** <br />
    Each mint and burn collects a fee portion to fund ecosystem growth and potential buybacks.

    5. **Governance** <br />
    Token holders gain voting rights to propose and decide on protocol changes, actively contributing to the chainâ€™s future.

    Push Chain adopts a dynamic supply model, which is used among popular chains (like Ethereum and Solana). Post mainnet, new tokens for the chain would be mined solely for node rewards, relayer rewards, and other participants that are required for ensuring chain security, functionality, and decentralization needs.

        },
        {
          type: 'text',
          value: `### Burn and Deflationary Mechanism

    Push Chain has a couple of burn mechanisms owing to it being a Universal Blockchain.

    1. **Native Chain Burn** <br />
    A part of the fees is always burned when native transactions are done on Push Chain.

    2. **Cross Chain Burn** <br />
    Using Universal Fee Abstractions, a part of the fee collected on other blockchainâ€™s native token (ETH, SOL) is swapped for Push Chain native token and burned.

    This ensures a deflationary blockchain design that burns tokens as the network and the transactions that happen on it grow. This design enables the creation of an incentivized, sustainable long-term future for Push Chain and all its participants.

          value: `### Migration Details

    Push Chain is the result of years of learning from building the leading notification and communication protocol of web3, which was one of the first consumer apps for crypto.

    Owing to this, apart from the airdrop allocated (see details below) to Push Chain users, creators, developers and ecosystem partners, **there is also a migration drop reserved for the $PUSH holders** (which was the native token of Push Protocol).


    <details>
      <summary>
      <b>Migration details for existing $PUSH token holders</b>

      </summary>

      **For existing $PUSH token holders**, the Push Chain tokenomics proposal allocates 15% of the total Push Chain token supply specifically for migration. The migration will occur at a ratio of **1:15**â€”meaning for each Push Protocol ($PUSH) token you hold, you'll receive 15 Push Chain tokens. For example, if you currently hold 40 $PUSH tokens, you'll receive 600 Push Chain tokens after migration.

      The launch of Push Chain is designed to reward and incentivize prior Push Protocol ($PUSH) holders for their loyalty and contribution. The migration process for existing $PUSH token holders will work as follows:

      - Tokens will migrate at a 1:15 ratio (1 Push Protocol token = 15 Push Chain tokens).
      - Participants in the Push Chain migration will see 50% of their migrated tokens unlocked immediately, and an additional 50% unlocked after 3 months.
      - Token migrators will also benefit from a dedicated yield farming pool reserved for them. These rewards will be distributed to token migrators if they stake their migrated Push Chain tokens, to reward them for long-term contribution to the ecosystem.
      - For example, if you have 100 Push Protocol $PUSH tokens, youâ€™ll receive 750 Push Chain tokens when you migrate and 750 Push Chain tokens after 3 months â€” for a total of 1,500 Push Chain tokens. You can choose to stake these tokens to get additional rewards from the Push Chain yield farming pool, distributed periodically.

      The Push Chain token migration will be open for 12 months after launch, after which any remaining tokens will go to the community and ecosystem reserve.

    4. Investors have 24-month linear vesting.
    5. Community and Ecosystem Reserves has a 13.5% unlock at TGE, followed by 36-month vesting.
