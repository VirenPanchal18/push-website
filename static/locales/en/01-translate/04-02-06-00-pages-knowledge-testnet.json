                  "why-push-exists": "## Why Push Chain Exists\n\nToday's Web3 ecosystem is heavily fragmented and overly complex.\n\nDevelopers redeploy smart contracts across multiple chains, users have to manually bridge tokens or switch wallets, and teams spend months maintaining chain-specific codebases and audits.\n\nEach new chain adds overhead, complexity, cost and friction, which massively slows innovation and adoption.\n\n**Push Chain eliminates this.**",

                  "how-reimagines-interoperability": "## Chain-native Interop\n\nMost interoperability today relies on external messaging layers or bridges. You manage multiple contracts, audits, and integrations across every chain.\n\n**Push Chain flips that model.** With Push, you:\n\n* **Deploy once, reach everywhere.** Your app instantly becomes available across chains, EVM or non-EVM.\n* **Drop redundant contracts and bridges.** Interoperability is native to the chain, so you focus on your app, not infrastructure.\n* **Stay fully EVM-compatible.** Use the same tooling, frameworks, and audits you already have.\n* **Serve users from any chain or wallet.** Users transact from their home chain using existing wallet. No manual bridging, no gas tokens, no network switching, no swapping, no setup.",

                  "how-to-participate": "## How do I Participate in the Network?\n\n### 👩‍💻 Developers\n\nPush Chain gives developers the power to **build once and deploy everywhere.**\n\nEvery **app runs natively** across all chains without extra integrations or separate deployments.\n\nThe chain currently supports **Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain** on testnet, with more chains coming soon.\n\nStart building your first Universal App:\n\n* Explore the [Documentation](https://push.org/docs)\n  Interact with live codeboxes, examples right from the docs.\n* Play around with [Ballsy App](https://ballsy.push.org)\n  Experience a Universal App in action. No wallet, gas juggling or setup required.\n* Apply for 🌱[Grassroot Program](https://zv9atndluia.typeform.com/to/ItQ7i2sO)\n  We are a developer-first chain. Want to take your app to the next level? Have persistence and passion? Apply to be included in our Grassroot Program and scale your app to reach every user.\n\n### 🌎Users\n\nExperience a Web3 that just works: No switching chains, bridging tokens, or learning required.\n\nUse your existing wallet to access any app on Push Chain and pay directly in your native token.\n\n* Try Universal Apps on our 🌳[Ecosystem Page](https://push.org/ecosystem)\n* Check activity of Donut Testnet on [Push Explorer](https://donut.push.network)\n\n### 🧑‍🚀 Node Operators\n\nPush Chain's network is powered by a decentralized set of validators.\n\nTo run a validator, execute the following command on Mac or Ubuntu:\n\n`curl -fsSL https://get.push.network/node/install.sh | bash`\n\nTo understand the different configs and what everything means, check out [Running Push Validator](https://push.org/docs/chain/node-and-system-tools/running-push-validator/).\n\nWhy run a testnet validator?\n\nRunning a testnet validator helps strengthen the network and shape its mainnet readiness. It may also include perks and benefits that will come with Season 3 of [Push Points Program](https://portal.push.org).\n\nTag [@pushchain](https://x.com/PushChain) and share your experience with us on X.",
