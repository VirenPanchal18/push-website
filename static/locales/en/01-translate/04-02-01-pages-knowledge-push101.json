                "why-push-chain": "## Why Push Chain?\n\nPush Chain is the first **true universal L1**, purpose built to enable apps to seamlessly be interact-able by users of any chain.\n\nWrite your smart contract once, deploy it on Push Chain, and instantly reach users on Ethereum, Solana, and all other supported chains without changing on-chain code.",
                "what-is-push-chain": "## What is Push Chain?\n\nPush Chain is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) L1 blockchain that is designed to eliminate fragmentation across all chains.\n\nIt is a **shared state L1** blockchain for **Universal (Interoperable) Apps** across chains. Push Chain enables transactions from any chain (Eth, Solana, EVM, or non-EVM), enabling apps from any chain to be accessed by the users of any chain (**polymarket** from any chain, **pump.fun** from any chain, etc).",
                "innovations-of-push-chain": "## Innovations of Push Chain\n\nPush Chain introduces several groundbreaking innovations such as:\n\n**True Universal L1** - Natively supports all chains and enables users to interact with the same app. No centralized relayers, bridges, or other hacks needed.\n\n**Universal Fee Abstraction** - Allows users to interact natively while being on the chain of their choice and using any tokens they want.\n\n**Wallet Abstraction** - Support MetaMask, Phantom, and other wallets as well as social or email login through one unified provider. Users never need to create a new wallet to access any apps.\n\n**Single transaction, no matter the chain** - users can interact with any app on Push Chain with a single transaction. No matter how they choose to interact with the app, they will only ever need to sign a single transaction.\n\n**Universal Smart Contracts** - Smart contracts are universal and will work instantly without any on-chain code changes or extra steps.\n\n**Shared State & Programmable Solvers** - Enables develepors to read and write state of other blockchains (Roadmap).\n\nThis results in **fully interoperable applications** for web3. In this paradigm, instead of being a user of \"Uniswap on Ethereum,\" \"Uniswap on Polygon,\" or \"Uniswap on Arbitrum,\" a person simply becomes a **user of Uniswap.**",
